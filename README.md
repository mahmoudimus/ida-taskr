## Overview

IDA Taskr is a pure Python library for IDA Pro related parallel computing. It lets you use the power of Qt (built-in to IDA!) and Python's powerful multiprocessing and asyncio systems to quickly process computationally intensive tasks without freezing IDA Pro. Oh, and it's super fast too.

## Testing 🧪

`ida-taskr` is thoroughly tested to ensure reliability.

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/
```

You'll see detailed output confirming the functionality of each component. ✅
